This program was written in python3, to compile this on the flip server you want to type python3 filename. this will run the program. (python3 `mergesort3.py`) (python3 `merge3Time.py`)

In this assignment the task was to compare the run times of mergesort3 and mergesort2, to see which one was the faster one out of the two.

In the program `mergesort3.py`, it reads from the file `data.txt` which has numbers in it, then you want to sort those numbers , and afterwards those numbers get outputs into the file `merge3.txt`.

In the program `merge3Time.py`, numbers are generated into an array ranging from 50000 to 500000. After sorting the data then the run time gets outputted to `merge3time.txt`, then this file is used in excel.
